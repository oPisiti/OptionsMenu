# OptionsMenu

This function loops printing a greeting and the options

The current option is printed in green and when chosen (enter key) returns that string

While the user chooses an option (arrow keys), everything inside this function is rewritten on top

of what is on screen. Nothing other than what is written INSIDE this function gets rewritten
